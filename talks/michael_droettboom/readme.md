Abstract : 
----------
This talk will be a general "state of the project address" for matplotlib, the 
popular plotting library in the scientific Python stack. It will provide an 
update about new features added to matplotlib over the course of the last year, 
outline some ongoing planned work, and describe some challenges to move into the 
future. The new features include a web browser backend, "sketch" style, and 
numerous other bugfixes and improvements. Also discussed will be the challenges 
and lessons learned moving to Python 3. Our new "MEP" (matplotlib enhancement 
proposal) method will be introduced, and the ongoing MEPs will be discussed, 
such as moving to properties, updating the docstrings, etc. Some of the more 
pie-in-the-sky plans (such as styling and serializing) will be discussed. It is 
hoped that this overview will be useful for those who use matplotlib, but don't 
necessarily follow its mailing list in detail, and also serve as a call to arms 
for assistance for the project.
