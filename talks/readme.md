  repository on GitHub.

- An example talk is provided in ``talks/jane_doe``.
  Create a new directory ``talks/firstname_surname``.

- Copy the contents of the example directory into it, and
  replace the example.pdf file with your actual presentation materials. 

- Edit the readme.md to include the title, co-authors, track, your abstract,

- License conditions on images and figures must be respected (Creative Commons,

- Any format is okay (html, pdf, ipynb), but we'd like to keep the total size 
  under GitHub's suggested 5GB limit, so please only include files of a reasonable 
  size.
