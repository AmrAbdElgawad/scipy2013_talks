SciPy2013 Talks and Posters
===========================

Instructions for Inclusion
--------------------------

Here are the steps to include your presentation or poster in this repository 
(tutorials folks can skip steps 2 and 3, go straight to your prepped directory):

1. Fork the [scipy2013_talks](https://github.com/scipy/scipy2013_talks)
  repository on GitHub.

1. An example talk is provided in ``talks/jane_doe`` and an example poster is 
  provided in ``posters/jane_doe``.  Create a new
  directory in either the talks or posters directory. Call it ``firstname_surname``.

1. Copy the contents of the example directory into it.

1. Edit the readme.md in your directory to include the title, co-authors, date, time, your abstract,
  and any other information that might be archivally useful. 

1. Fill the directory with your actual presentation materials. **If 
   all of your material is already online, just include a link in the readme.** 

1. Once you are ready to submit your materials, file a pull request on GitHub.

1. Please do not modify any files outside of your talk or poster directory.

Pull requests submitted soon are more likely to be included.

General Guidelines
------------------

- License conditions on images and figures must be respected (Creative Commons,
  etc.).

- Any format is okay (html, pdf, ipynb), but we'd like to keep the total size 
  under GitHub's suggested 5GB limit, so please only include files of a reasonable 
  size.
