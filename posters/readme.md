SciPy2013 Posters
==================

Instructions for Inclusion
--------------------------

Here are the steps to include your poster in this repository:

- Fork the `scipy2013_talks <https://github.com/scipy/scipy2013_talks>`__
  repository on GitHub.

- An example poster is provided in ``posters/jane_doe``.  Create a new
  directory ``posters/firstname_surname``.

- Copy the contents of the example directory into it, and
  replace the example.pdf file with your actual presentation materials. 

- Edit the readme.md to include the title, co-authors, your abstract,
  and any other information that might be archivally useful. 

- Once you are ready to submit your materials, file a pull request on GitHub.

- Please do not modify any files outside of your poster directory.

Pull requests submitted soon are more likely to be included.

General Guidelines
------------------

- License conditions on images and figures must be respected (Creative Commons,
  etc.).

- Any format is okay (html, pdf, ipynb), but we'd like to keep the total size 
  under GitHub's suggested 5GB limit, so please only include files of a reasonable 
  size.
